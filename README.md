This website was created as a presentation of the skills I've gained on my way to learning to code. It was my first project and is pretty basic. 

Honestly, it's mostly just a testing ground for new skills I pick up as I go though The Odin Project, freeCodeCamp, Zenva, Udemy ect. As an example, I made a commit from the command line via git to make sure that I understood workflow and how to make local commits and push them to github. Maybe over time it will evolve into something that I will include in my portfolio when seeking a job but right now it's just a simple personal project for learning purposes only.
