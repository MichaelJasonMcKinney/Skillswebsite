            This webpage was created to showcase my skills as a web developer. As my skills grow so will this webpage.You could call this a functional cover letter. Currently, it will take you to my GitHub by clicking on an image that is also a link(with a functional
            title on hover). It has a list element detailing which languages I know. It uses header, paragraph, and div elements to organize content and then has a CSS file to style it. The goal is to demonstrate ability to organize content using popular
            strategies in HTML, CSS and to later add functionality with Javascript. As I grow as a web developer, I will add on to this website to demonstrate more advanced techniques and layers of functionality that I can integrate. It obviously won't
            implement every single thing I know about front-end web development(to build a website like that without it becoming cluttered and disorganized would be very difficult), but hopefully it will demonstrate to you that I know how do use the concepts
            i have at my disposal to build something that works well from scratch and hopefully one day this project turns into something really interesting. Right now its pretty simple but I hope you like it!

            cirriculum to build projects to include in portfolio's. This website is one such project amoung several planned. You can check back on my GitHub at a later date if you want just to see what else I've been doing. If you have any questions about
